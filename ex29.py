#Study drills
#1.)	What do you think the if does to the code?
## "what if that then do that"???
#2.)	Why does the code under the if need to be indented four spaces?
##
#3.)	What happens if it isn't indented?
##
##4.)	Can you put other boolean expressions from, Exercise27 in the if = statement? Try it.
##
##5.)	What happens if you change the initial variables for people, cats, and dogs?
##changes the lines which is printed out.
